	<p>3 Reasons Why You Should Vote Against School Uniforms</p>

School uniforms have been becoming more and more popular, and the reasons as to why differ. This list represents the 3 reasons why you should not vote for school uniforms at your school.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. Freedom of expression is extremely limited by uniforms<br/>
This breaks the first amendment of the United States, which is far more important than whether students pay attention more attention to school or their clothes, mostly because they only pay attention to their clothes when they are getting ready for school.
<br/>
<br/>
 2. School uniforms do not decrease the amount of bullying<br/>
 One of the main selling points for uniforms is that they reduce bullying, but most schools report an increase in bullying after uniforms have been implemented.
<br/>
<br/>
 3. School uniforms are basically the same as the school dressing them<br/>
 If a child has their clothes picked out for them by one of their parents for their entire school life, they will not know what to do if they need to pick out their own clothes for social events.
